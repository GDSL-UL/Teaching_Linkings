# Teaching Links

##Introduction
In this repo we aim to provide links to useful teaching resources for Geographic / Spatial Data Science, GIS and Statistics.

With the spread of COVID-19 and the ongoing international response efforts, it is looking like a lot of the academic community will be delivering teaching remotely and online. 

We do not claim any of the resources are fully fledged online courses, or that these are comprehensive. But we either have written a lot of material within the Geographic Data Science Lab or know of other excellent resources which though might be helpful to the community to list and share.
