# Teaching Links

## Introduction
In this repo we aim to provide links to useful teaching resources for Geographic / Spatial Data Science, GIS and Statistics.

With the spread of COVID-19 and the ongoing international response efforts, it is looking like a lot of the academic community will be delivering teaching remotely and online. 

We do not claim any of the resources are fully fledged online courses, or that these are comprehensive. But we either have written a lot of material within the Geographic Data Science Lab or know of other excellent resources which we thought might be helpful to the community to list and share.


## Full Syllabus

### Urban Analytics
This provides 15 practicals in R with Slides - associated with (but independent from the [book](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/urban-analytics/book249267)) https://github.com/alexsingleton/urban_analytics ; topics include R, SQL, Descriptive Statistics, Charts and Graphs, Mapping Areas, Mapping Points, Web Mapping, Mapping Flows, Geodemographics, Indices, Spatial Relationships, Regression, Agent Based Models and Network Analysis.

Material and website for the course Geographic Data Science'19, taught
at the University of Liverpool. The course was open to
last year undergraduate and master students and uses Python.

### Geographic Data Science with PySAL and the PyData, the book (WIP)

This is an upcoming book being developed in the open to cover an introduction to Geographic Data Science using PySAL and the rest of the Python stack for data science.

### An Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis and Visualisation in R
This tutorial series is designed to provide an accessible introduction to techniques for handling, analysing and visualising spatial data in R. 12 Practicals including basic descriptive statistics, making maps (or various sorts), Geographically Weighted Regression, point pattern analysis and some help with loops.

## Short Course / Practical Labs

### Creating a Geodemographic Classification Using K-means Clustering in R
This tutorial provides you with the basic skills to build your own geodemographic classification using R.

### Kings College London Geocomputation
Lots of content is available here - https://github.com/kingsgeocomp ; but some higlights include:

* https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/code-camp (Introduction to Programming)
  * Some general help to install Anaconda and/or Docker: https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/gsa_env
* https://kingsgeocomputation.org/teaching/code-camp/code-camp-python/  (Introduction to Python - with Binder)
* https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/geocomputation (Foundational Module: Pandas, Seaborn and basic data science...)
* https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/spatial-analysis (Building on the above - some specific spatial content)
* https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/applied_gsa (Some advanced content including clustering; not a full course, but useful content)


## Online Course / Tool Providers

### Coursera
Coursera are providing free access to impacted universities: https://blog.coursera.org/helping-universities-and-colleges-go-fully-online-in-response-to-the-coronavirus/ - There is a lot of [GIS](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=GIS&) content.

### Microsoft
Some useful guidance here about how to use Teams for remote learning: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/remote-learning-edu
